Description: Integrate Item Response Theory (IRT) and Federated Learning to estimate traditional IRT models, including the 2-Parameter Logistic (2PL) and the Graded Response Models, with enhanced privacy. It allows for the estimation in a distributed manner without compromising accuracy. A user-friendly 'shiny' application is included. For more details, see Biying Zhou, Feng Ji (2024) "'FedIRT': An R package and 'shiny' app for estimating federated item response theory models" <https://github.com/Feng-Ji-Lab/FedIRT/blob/main/paper/paper.pdf>.
